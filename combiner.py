# Alright, here's a fun task!
# Create a function named combiner that takes a single argument, which will be a list made up of strings and numbers.
# Return a single string that is a combination of all of the strings in the list and then the sum of all of the numbers.
# For example, with the input ["apple", 5.2, "dog", 8], combiner would return "appledog13.2".
# Be sure to use isinstance to solve this as I might try to trick you.


def combiner(*args):
    # TODO: Determine the datatype of an argument. Split into str and num
    # Use isinstance() to determine datatype
    print(args)
    # TODO: Create a sum of all of the numbers

    # TODO: Concatnate all the strings

    # TODO: Concatnate strings with sum
