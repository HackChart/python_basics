import pdb

# You can use the debugger by importing the pdb module and using set_trace to start tracking
# The debugger allows you to run through your code line by line
# n or next will take you the next line while c will  complete the script

pdb.set_trace()  # From this line on, the debugger will track the script
print("Hello, world")

# REMEMBER TO REMOVE PDB AFTER THE PROBLEM IS FIXED
